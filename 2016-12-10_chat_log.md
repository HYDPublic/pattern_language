11:27 AMÉdouard U.microphone broken
11:27 AMÉdouard U.i'll type thoughts
11:27 AMÉdouard U.oh yeah holy shit this book was so utopian
11:28 AMÉdouard U.i was loling
11:28 AMÉdouard U.at like, the idea that countryside and city could co-exist in the same spaces
11:28 AMÉdouard U.these days
11:28 AMÉdouard U.that point reminds me: I started writing in the book at certain points that I felt needed updates
11:29 AMÉdouard U.since it was written in the 70s and all
11:29 AMÉdouard U.quite a bit
11:30 AMÉdouard U.it's hard to type these thoughts
11:30 AMÉdouard U.heh
11:30 AMÉdouard U.i'll like
11:30 AMÉdouard U.update in the slack
11:30 AMÉdouard U.at a later point

11:32 AMÉdouard U.same
11:35 AMÉdouard U.re that idea
11:35 AMÉdouard U.'how much of this is possible/outdated'
11:36 AMÉdouard U.that makes me think that it makes a lot of sense that software architects picked this book up
11:36 AMÉdouard U.since the physical contraints are too much
11:36 AMÉdouard U.yesss

11:46 AMÉdouard U.the dude menicious moldbug wrote essays on that topic
11:46 AMÉdouard U.he's currently trying to create cryptographic 'property'
11:47 AMÉdouard U.via Urbit
11:47 AMÉdouard U.i think piecemeal, some of these things sound super applicable
11:50 AMÉdouard U.which is technically alexander's point he made in an earlier paragraph
11:50 AMÉdouard U.is that you can't uproot
11:50 AMÉdouard U.nyc
11:50 AMÉdouard U.for example
