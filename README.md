##### A Pattern Language: Reading Group & Notes
###### Reading group for [A Pattern Language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Pattern_Language).

—

We meet approximately biweekly, reading ~100 pages at a time. Each session is conducted by one of the group members. 

We’re doing this mostly just to read the book, but are also interested in applications of systems and pattern languages in our own lives and work.
