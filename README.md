# pattern_language
Reading group for [A Pattern Language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Pattern_Language). 

We meet approximately biweekly, reading ~100 pages at a time. Each session is conducted by one of the group members. 

Weâ€™re doing this mostly just to read the book, but are also interested in applications of systems and pattern languages in our own lives and work.
