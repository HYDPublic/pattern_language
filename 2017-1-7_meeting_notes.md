Meeting 3 (for ~1/7/17) â†’ Pattern 48 / pg. 258 (110 pages)

a couple of these sections on density imply a zoning system based around density rather than use, similar to [japanese zoning systems](http://urbankchoze.blogspot.com/2014/04/japanese-zoning.html)

Viewing of [pioneer square in seattle](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Pioneer+Square,+Seattle,+WA+98104/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x54906aa4ebc58a73:0x387ef3dcb4e389c?sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj8zInPg7HRAhWHqVQKHZ7wDdgQ8gEIgQEwDw) as an unsuccessful Activity Node:
- active at night but not during the day
- wide streets discourage impromptu gatherings

core thesis of APL: wide streets = no people

a few cities have 'car free days' to encourage Promenade behavior
- [lower east side NYC](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Lower+East+Side,+New+York,+NY/@40.7170172,-74.0023849,14.35z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x89c2598015ac8beb:0x59b849fea56b6a70!8m2!3d40.715033!4d-73.9842724) on Sundays
- [King St in Charleston](https://www.google.com/maps/place/King+St,+Charleston,+SC/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x88fe7a420abe4e23:0xc4d9a2e9fc9e31df?sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjMjNy6hLHRAhWKrFQKHbaFDuoQ8gEIHzAB)

so many of these patterns rely on the major traffic arteries running perpendicular to ambulatory friendly roads

Society seems to view well lit spaces as 'Safe' and poorly lit spaces as 'Dangerous'. We feel safer if we are 'Seen' (talking on the phone/video chatting while walking through dark places). Can we make any place safer by lighting it more? Enter short story potential:
- make the moon brighter "Two Suns"
- light as a capitalistic force (how have our work schedules changed with developoments in artificial light)
- light as work

Interchange failures can promote unity
- trudging through snow in toronto
- climbing stairs with a huge herd of people in Shibuya

this book feels like an idealized (impossible) system meant to be held in tension with the pragmatic ad-hoc planning behind most projects

how do we balance the creative community of young people in isolation with blending of life cycles? this may be a false dichotomy

housing hills sound dope but difficult to implement, requires terraforming to create multi-level building pads

American fear of death manifested in how we isolate our elders. Our Culture/zoning laws tends towards homogenous age and use groupings (old folks homes and separate work/industrial zones). This reinforces the *`unreal charade`* and the *`plastic unreality`* of contemporary society. love these terms

Yes to mixed work communities! various fields interacting builds empathy and interdisciplinary potential

are there potential benefits to economies of scale that APL misses? the affordability provided by big box stores, how to balance that with more ethical consumption and community building

Shout out to LG for the *`University as Marketplace`*. stark opposition to US school system, Amardeep mentions [this vid](https://www.c-span.org/video/?67583-1/technology-education). Reminded of orgs like coding bootcamps and general assembly as well.

Could we make town halls more accessible with digital versions of them? Using voter info and real names for accountability and ease of use.

*`Necklace of Community Projects`* sounds great but how to build into existing neighborhoods? Publicly owned trucks with large platform for booths and copy machines, could circle the block slowly and allow people to hop on and off (could also work with zeppelins?). The Necklace also sounds like a publicly supported media outlet

Thinking about new awareness post-election around how media companies are supported, and taking a more active subscriber role, acknowledging financially what media we value. Melanie mentioned Blundle(? can't find the link) allowing readers to pay journalists per article.

we need more combination dance/medical clubs. `free physical with drink ticket`

anyone have links for groups that are pursuing the health first rather than symptomatic care?
